I’m Con, an analytics consultant living in Yorkshire in the UK. I’ve spent the last 10 years working on data engineering and business intelligence projects. 

In my spare time I like to experiment with new tools and ways of working. I wanted to write this blog to share some of the useful things I've learned.

Most of my experience has been gained from developing data pipelines using Python and various flavours of SQL databases, finally presenting the data with Tableau.

I have a particular passion for using open source software. I'm always on the lookout for new toys to make working with data easier and faster.
